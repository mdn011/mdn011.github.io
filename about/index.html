  On really romantic evenings of self, I go salsa dancing with my confusion.
  â€” quote from Waking Life

  Hello classmates! All of your final projects were awesome. Thanks for taking the time to view mine!

  This website was designed as a final project for a beginner's HTML/CSS course at Mesa Community College in San Diego.
  If you do plan on taking this course, I highly recommend Professor Marianne Gibson.
  I have also taken introductory courses in SQL and PHP with her as as well, and the experience has been fantastic.

  Good luck and may all of your dreams come true!
