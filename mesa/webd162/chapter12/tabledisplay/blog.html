              <p> As promised, today I'm proud to announce that Starbuzz
                  Coffee is launching the Tweet Sip cup, a special Starbuzz
                  Coffee cup that tweets each time you take a sip! Check
                  out my video of our new invention. </p>

              <p> Here at Starbuzz we're embracing the social media craze.
                  In fact, we're going further than any of our competitors and
                  we're very close to announcing a revolutionary new product that
                  links your coffee drinking directly to your social
                  network. Forget "checking in"; we're going way beyond that, and
                  with this new product every sip of smooth, aromatic, hot Starbuzz
                  blend is going to to be shared with your social network. </p>
              <p> Sound like science fiction?  It's not; I'm already
                  testing our final prototype social network cup as I write this,
                  which links you, the drinker, right to your favorite social
                  networks.  We've made a huge investment to make this happen
                  and we've created a reusable coffee cup complete with RFID,
                  NFC, Bluetooth, and Wifi (not to mention a few more things the tech
                  folks know about, because hey, I'm just the coffee guy). </p>
              <p> So, keep your eyes out for this amazing new cup. And I'll
                  be releasing a video teaser soon to tell you all about this
                  new invention, straight from Starbuzz Coffee. </p>

              </header>
              <p> Have you ever noticed how efficient a Starbuzz Coffee
                  house is? The lines alway move fast, and despite the
                  astronomical number of different drinks any customer can
                  order, we have your drink up, hot (or cold if that's the
                  way you want it) and ready in seconds. How do we do it? </p>
              <p> To pull this off, we take advantage of the latest and
                  greatest in computer science.  In fact, we train
                  our staff to be one big distributed computer.  The cashiers
                  create the orders for the distributed computer, complete
                  with your name and the drinks special instructions.  Then
                  our specialized drink makers grab the next cup
                  and go about working on your order until it's finished. </p>
              <p> With this design, we are able to horizontally scale our operation
                  any time we want.  All we need to do is add more cashiers
                  and drink makers (not to mention a fair amount of support
                  staff you never see) as the customer flow grows. </p>

              <p> Our most unique patron of the month award goes to a
                  customer in Poulsbo, Washington, whose daily morning order
                  is a "six-splenda, no-foam, 130-degree non-fat-soy latte,
                  with the splenda stirred in before the milk is added." Do we
                  have unique customers or what? </p>
