          And, did we mention <em>caffeine</em>? We've just started funding the guys doing all 
          the wonderful research at the <a href="http://buzz.headfirstlabs.com"
          title="Read all about caffeine on the Buzz">Caffeine Buzz</a>.

        <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
        <p>
          "A man, a plan, a coffee bean". Okay, that doesn't make a palindrome, but it resulted
          in a damn good cup of coffee.  Starbuzz's CEO is that man, and you already know his 
          plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.
        </p> 
        <p>In only a few years he's executed that plan and today 
          you can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere.  And, of course, the big news this year 
          is that Starbuzz teamed up with Head First readers to create Starbuzz's Web presence,  
          which is growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a whole new set of 
          customers.  
        </p>
